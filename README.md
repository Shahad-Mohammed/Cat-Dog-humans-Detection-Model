# Cat-Dog-humans-Detection-Model
developing a Cat, Dog, and Human Detection Model project Using a cascade classifier. 

 A Cascade classifier can be defined in the following way:

“It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.”

By positive images, we mean the objects we want to detect.
By negative images, we mean all the objects we want to avoid.
